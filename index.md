## Games

### Cup Pong AR

Play beer pong by yourself or with friends using Augmented Reality!

In Single Player mode, you can progress through a variety of different levels, with the shots getting harder each time. 

<b>Play with Friends</b>


Multiplayer is cross-platform! Play against friends on Android or iOS!

With Local Multiplayer mode, you can play against a friend who is in the same physical room as you. This mode uses augmented reality to render the same, shared digital pong table for both players.

With Online Multiplayer mode, you can play against a friend, wherever they may be! Each player has their own digital pong table, so the players do not need to be in the same physical room.

<b> Custom Skins </b>

Customize your look! Unlock new appearances for the pong balls and pong tables, and use those appearances when you play against your friends!
