### Description

Play pong by yourself or with friends using Augmented Reality!

In Single Player mode, you can progress through a variety of different levels, with the shots getting harder each time. 

<b>Play with Friends</b>


Multiplayer is cross-platform! Play against friends on Android or iOS!

With Local Multiplayer mode, you can play against a friend who is in the same physical room as you. This mode uses augmented reality to render the same, shared digital pong table for both players.

With Online Multiplayer mode, you can play against a friend, wherever they may be! Each player has their own digital pong table, so the players do not need to be in the same physical room.

<b> Custom Skins </b>

Customize your look! Unlock new appearances for the pong balls and pong tables, and use those appearances when you play against your friends!


### History

Cup Pong AR is Space Dog XR's first augmented reality mobile game. At the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown, founder Tate Travaglini was looking for a project to keep him busy during the quarantine that incorporated augmented reality (AR). He decided to take up Cup Pong AR as a way for students and friends to play pong together while allowing them to stay socially distanced. Cup Pong AR was released for Android and iOS in September 2020.


### Technology

Cup Pong AR is powered by Unity and its AR Foundation library. AR Foundation allows Space Dog XR to more quickly publish our augmented reality game to both Android and iOS. Cup Pong AR's "Local Multiplayer" mode is a compelling use of Google's Cloud Anchor technology; these cloud anchors enable the same table to be rendered for both players in the same physical space.
